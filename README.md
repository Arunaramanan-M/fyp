Our project considers a cell-free massive multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) system that consists of geographically distributed access points (APs) serving multiple users. The downlink performance of the system is evaluated, with maximum ratio and regularized zero-forcing precoding, under two optimization objectives for power allocation: sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization and proportional fairness.
We train a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the  network-wide power allocation. 
Further, we develop a clustered DNN model for a small number of APs, forming a cluster within a relatively large network, are used to jointly approximate the power coefficients of the cluster.
